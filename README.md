## This GitHub repository contains various projects related to genetic algorithms. Each project is contained within its own folder and has its own documentation, including a separate README file.

### 1. Function Optimalization

In this project, we aim to optimize a mathematical function using a genetic algorithm. The program allows us to input a mathematical function and set the parameters for the genetic algorithm. The algorithm then finds the global minimum of the function using a population of candidate solutions which evolve over time through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The results can be visualized in a graph, allowing us to see the progression of the optimization process.
